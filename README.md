# iOS Job Interview Coding Assignment #

This assignment was originally created to support the hiring of iOS developers for the LA office in the first half of 2016. The assignment is intended as 'home work' to be done by the candidate before we have her or him come over to the office.

### What is in this repository? ###

* The files to send to the candidate. There is a PDF with the actual assignment and two data files which the candidate needs.
* The Word document used to create the PDF.
